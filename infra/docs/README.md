Documentation gets it's own directory. For diagrams, I've used things like lucidchart and [Cloudcraft](https://www.cloudcraft.co/).
Typically it's good practice to include your automation/infra as code for monitoring
via tools such as datadog alongside this and then you can include links directly in the documentation to 
the monitoring resources created and reference the source for them in the repo as well.
