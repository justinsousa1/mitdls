I really like AWS codebuild as a runtime environment for calling packer. Can't say I use the other AWS
code pipeline/ci tools too much as I prefer other ci/cd tools, but codebuild is great. As for tools for configuring servers,
I very much :heart: ansible but would be open to learning other tools such as chef/puppet. They all do mostly the same thing.
